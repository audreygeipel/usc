Compiling the software

# There are two different compiling options(automatic and manual)

Automatic

# Makefile is included in the package.
# Only step is running "make" command in application's directory through command line
# Or If you want to clean the application directory you can call "make clean" command.
# This command removed all compiled files.

Manual

# To compile software manually there are few steps which has to be done.
# These commands should be called one by one in application's directory
  * g++ -g -Wall -c game.cpp
  * g++ -g -Wall -c gamelist.cpp
  * g++ -g -Wall -c cli.cpp
  * g++ -g -Wall -c database.cpp  
  * g++ -g -Wall -c main.cpp
  * g++ -g -Wall game.o gamelist.o database.o cli.o main.o -o main
