High-level Architecture
-----------------------
+ Application class is the core class
+ It starts game based on user's command
+ If if user want to resume the game, it tells game class to first load the save file.
+ Game class stores everything about game
+ It has variables called world, player etc. All these classes belongs to game class.
+ World class is responsible for map and printing it.
+ World class all the objects on the map.
+ Player class is responsible for players information such as position and score.
+ Also there is a static class called IO. It just has some short cut IO functions.
+ And lastly there are object classes for map items.
+ Map is stored as 2 level int array. Every int in this array is a pixel on the screen.
+ These integer tells the which type of objects sits in that pixel
+ Every object has its own unique id.
+ These map objects classes are also static. We do not store map as an array of classes.
+ Application -> Game -> (Player -> (score, position), World -> (map))
