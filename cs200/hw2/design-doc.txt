High-level Architecture
-----------------------
+ Application class is the core class
+ It manages game class and deals with command line interface
+ Game class stores everything about game
+ It is responsible for starting, resuming, quiting, saving and loading the game. 
+ World class manages all the objects in the map.
+ Map is stored as an ArrayList of MapObjects
+ MapObject class is an abstract class for all the map objects
+ GameFrame class is the main gui class
+ It renders 2 different panels in the frame, these are WorlPanel and ScorePanel
+ It uses BorderLayout to locate these 2 panels
+ WorldPanel class is responsible for printing the world.
+ It uses GridLayout to manage objects.
+ ScorePanel class is responsible for printing the user related information
